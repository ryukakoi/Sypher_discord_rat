## üìñ Overview

This is a proof-of-concept Remote Administration Tool (RAT) that uses Discord's API for communication. It is designed to demonstrate how seemingly benign applications can be leveraged for command and control (C2) operations. This project is intended for cybersecurity education, helping students and professionals understand attack vectors to better defend against them.

2. Enter bot and guild id
3. compile or run 


## üî¨ How to Use for Learning

1.  **Study the Code:** Analyze how the client communicates with the C2 server.
2.  **Monitor Network Traffic:** Use tools like Wireshark to observe the traffic it generates. Can you detect it?
3.  **Practice Defense:** Use this tool in a virtual lab to test:
    *   Antivirus/EDR detection rates.
    *   Network monitoring and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
    *   Forensic analysis and incident response procedures.
